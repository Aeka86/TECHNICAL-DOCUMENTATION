          Congratulations on choosing TypeScript as one of your first languages
          — you’re already making good decisions.
        </p>

        <p>
          You’ve probably already heard that TypeScript is a “flavor” or
          “variant” of JavaScript. The relationship between TypeScript (TS) and
          JavaScript (JS) is rather unique among modern programming languages,
          so learning more about this relationship will help you understand how
          TypeScript adds to JavaScript.
        </p>

        <h1>What is JavaScript? A Brief History</h1>

        <p>
          JavaScript (also known as ECMAScript) started its life as a simple
          scripting language for browsers. At the time it was invented, it was
          expected to be used for short snippets of code embedded in a web page
          — writing more than a few dozen lines of code would have been somewhat
          unusual. Due to this, early web browsers executed such code pretty
          slowly. Over time, though, JS became more and more popular, and web
          developers started using it to create interactive experiences.
        </p>

        <p>
          Web browser developers responded to this increased JS usage by
          optimizing their execution engines (dynamic compilation) and extending
          what could be done with it (adding APIs), which in turn made web
          developers use it even more. On modern websites, your browser is
          frequently running applications that span hundreds of thousands of
          lines of code. This is long and gradual growth of “the web”, starting
          as a simple network of static pages, and evolving into a platform for
          rich <i>applications</i>> of all kinds.
        </p>

        <p>
          More than this, JS has become popular enough to be used outside the
          context of browsers, such as implementing JS servers using node.js.
          The “run anywhere” nature of JS makes it an attractive choice for
          cross-platform development. There are many developers these days that
          use <i>only</i> JavaScript to program their entire stack!
        </p>

        <p>
          To summarize, we have a language that was designed for quick uses, and
          then grew to a full-fledged tool to write applications with millions
          of lines. Every language has its own <i>quirks</i> — oddities and
          surprises, and JavaScript’s humble beginning makes it have
          <i>many</i> of these. Some examples:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            JavaScript’s equality operator (==) coerces its arguments, leading
            to unexpected behavior:
            <code>
              if ("" == 0) { // It is! But why?? } if (1 < x < 3) { // True for
              *any* value of x! }
            </code>
          </li>
          <li>
            JavaScript also allows accessing properties which aren’t present:
            <code>
              const obj = { width: 10, height: 15 }; // Why is this NaN?
              Spelling is hard! const area = obj.width * obj.heigth;
            </code>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Over 20 years after its introduction to the programming community,
          JavaScript is now one of the most widespread cross-platform languages
          ever created. Starting as a small scripting language for adding
          trivial interactivity to webpages, JavaScript has grown to be a
          language of choice for both frontend and backend applications of every
          size. While the size, scope, and complexity of programs written in
          JavaScript has grown exponentially, the ability of the JavaScript
          language to express the relationships between different units of code
          has not. Combined with JavaScript’s rather peculiar runtime semantics,
          this mismatch between language and program complexity has made
          JavaScript development a difficult task to manage at scale.
        </p>

        <p>
          The most common kinds of errors that programmers write can be
          described as type errors: a certain kind of value was used where a
          different kind of value was expected. This could be due to simple
          typos, a failure to understand the API surface of a library, incorrect
          assumptions about runtime behavior, or other errors. The goal of
          TypeScript is to be a static typechecker for JavaScript programs - in
          other words, a tool that runs before your code runs (static) and
          ensures that the types of the program are correct (typechecked).
        </p>

        <p>
          If you are coming to TypeScript without a JavaScript background, with
          the intention of TypeScript being your first language, we recommend
          you first start reading the documentation on either the
          <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/javascript/" target="_blank"
            >Microsoft Learn JavaScript tutorial</a
          >
          or read
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide"
            target="_blank"
            >JavaScript at the Mozilla Web Docs</a
          >. If you have experience in other languages, you should be able to
          pick up JavaScript syntax quite quickly by reading the handbook.

          TypeScript provides several utility types to facilitate common type
          transformations. These utilities are available globally.
        </p>

        <p>
          Constructs a type with all properties of Type set to optional. This
          utility will return a type that represents all subsets of a given
          type. Example
        </p>
        <code>
          interface Todo { title: string; description: string; } function
          updateTodo(todo: Todo, fieldsToUpdate: Partial Todo ) { return {
          ...todo, ...fieldsToUpdate }; } const todo1 = { title: "organize
          desk", description: "clear clutter", }; const todo2 =
          updateTodo(todo1, { description: "throw out trash", });
        </code>
        <p>
          Constructs a type consisting of all properties of Type set to
          required. The opposite of Partial. Example
        </p>
        <code>
          interface Props { a?: number; b?: string; } const obj: Props = { a: 5
          }; const obj2: Required Props = { a: 5 };

        <p>
          This overview page contains a shortened version of all the release
          notes for TypeScript. Because this page is so big. code samples have
          their interactive elements disabled.
        </p>

        <h1>TypeScript 4.2</h1>
        <p>
          TypeScript has a way to declare new names for types called type
          aliases. If you’re writing a set of functions that all work on
          <code>string | number | boolean </code>, you can write a type alias to
          avoid repeating yourself over and over again.
        </p>
        <code> type BasicPrimitive = number | string | boolean; </code>
        <p>
          In TypeScript 4.2, our internals are a little smarter. We keep track
          of how types were constructed by keeping around parts of how they were
          originally written and constructed over time. We also keep track of,
          and differentiate, type aliases to instances of other aliases!
        </p>

        <p>
          Being able to print back the types based on how you used them in your
          code means that as a TypeScript user, you can avoid some unfortunately
          humongous types getting displayed, and that often translates to
          getting better .d.ts file output, error messages, and in-editor type
          displays in quick info and signature help. This can help TypeScript
          feel a little bit more approachable for newcomers.
        </p>

        </p>
        <h1>Leading/Middle Rest Elements in Tuple Types</h1>
        <p>
          In TypeScript, tuple types are meant to model arrays with specific
          lengths and element types.
        </p>
        <code>
          // A tuple that stores a pair of numbers let a: [number, number] = [1,
          2]; // A tuple that stores a string, a number, and a boolean let b:
          [string, number, boolean] = ["hello", 42, true];
        </code>
        <p>
          In TypeScript 4.2, rest elements specifically been expanded in how
          they can be used. In prior versions, TypeScript only allowed ...rest
          elements at the very last position of a tuple type. However, now rest
          elements can occur anywhere within a tuple - with only a few
          restrictions.
        </p>
        <code>
          let foo: [...string[], number]; foo = [123]; foo = ["hello", 123]; foo
          = ["hello!", "hello!", "hello!", 123]; let bar: [boolean, ...string[],
          boolean]; bar = [true, false]; bar = [true, "some text", false]; bar =
          [true, "some", "separated", "text", false];
        </code>
